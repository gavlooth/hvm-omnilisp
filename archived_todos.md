          pattern_bindings_add(bindings, name, value);
      }
  }
  ```

- [DONE] Label: CP-5.2-pattern-var-extraction-codegen
  Location: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c:2673-2743`
  What was done:
  - Added `PatternVarList` struct for compile-time variable extraction
  - Added `extract_pattern_vars()` - recursively collects variable names
  - Skips reserved keywords: `_`, `nil`, `true`, `false`, `as`
  - Handles `as` patterns correctly
  Code snippet:
  ```c
  static void extract_pattern_vars(OmniValue* pattern, PatternVarList* vars) {
      if (omni_is_sym(pattern)) {
          pattern_var_list_add(vars, pattern->str_val);
      }
      if (omni_is_array(pattern) && pattern->array.len == 3) {
          // Check for 'as' pattern
          if (strcmp(middle->str_val, "as") == 0) {
              extract_pattern_vars(pattern->array.data[0], vars);
              pattern_var_list_add(vars, name->str_val);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- [DONE] Label: CP-5.2-match-codegen-bindings
  Location: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c:2965-3042`
  What was done:
  - Updated `codegen_match` to use `prim_pattern_match` for patterns with variables
  - Emits code to extract bindings into local Obj* variables
  - Falls back to simple `is_pattern_match` when no variables present
  Code snippet (updated to use dict_get_by_name):
  ```c
  if (has_bindings) {
      omni_codegen_emit(ctx, "Obj* _bindings = prim_pattern_match(pattern, _match_value);\n");
      omni_codegen_emit(ctx, "if (_bindings) {\n");
      for (int i = 0; i < vars.count; i++) {
          omni_codegen_emit(ctx, "Obj* %s = dict_get_by_name(_bindings, \"%s\");\n",
                            vars.names[i], vars.names[i]);
      }
      // ... result expression with variables in scope
  }
  ```

- [DONE] Label: CP-5.2-test-pattern-bindings
  Location: `runtime/tests/test_pattern_match.c`
  What was done:
  - 12 comprehensive tests for pattern matching with bindings
  - Tests simple variable binding, nested patterns, as patterns
  - Tests rest patterns, wildcards, literal matching
  - Tests edge cases: length mismatch, insufficient elements, reserved keywords
  All tests pass.

- [DONE] Label: CP-5.2-rest-patterns
  Location: `runtime/src/runtime.c:573-612`
  What was done:
  - Added `find_rest_position()` to detect `..` (spread) in pattern arrays
  - Modified `is_pattern_match_with_bindings()` to handle rest patterns
  - Pattern `[x y .. rest]` matching `[1 2 3 4 5]` gives x=1, y=2, rest=[3 4 5]
  - Empty rest is allowed: `[x y .. rest]` matching `[1 2]` gives rest=[]

- [DONE] Label: CP-5.2-dict-get-by-name
  Location: `runtime/src/runtime.c:1312-1336`
  What was done (bug fix):
  - Added `dict_get_by_name()` function for symbol key lookup by string content
  - Hashmap uses pointer identity for keys, but symbols aren't interned
  - `dict_get_by_name(dict, "x")` iterates buckets and compares symbol names
  - Declared in `omni.h:1110`

### Phase 5.3: Module System [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] Label: CP-5.3-module-struct
  Location: `runtime/src/modules.c:31-94`
  What exists:
  - Module struct with name, exports (linked list), imports (linked list)

  - Added dispatch in `codegen_list` for `defmodule` and `module` forms

- [DONE] Label: CP-5.3-qualified-symbols
  Location: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c:1314-1321`
  What was done:
  - Modified `codegen_sym()` to detect `/` or `.` in symbol names
  - Qualified symbols like `math/add` or `math.add` emit `prim_resolve(mk_string("..."))`
  - Runtime resolution via `prim_resolve()` in modules.c

  5. Codegen: Added `codegen_symbol_array()` for generating symbol list literals
  6. Codegen: Updated `codegen_import()` to parse `:only`, `:as`, `:except` options
  7. Codegen: Updated `codegen_defmodule()` to handle advanced imports in `:import` clause
  Supported syntax:
    - `(import mod :only [a b])` → `prim_import_only(mk_sym("mod"), ...)`
    - `(import mod :as m)` → `prim_import_as(mk_sym("mod"), mk_sym("m"))`
    - `(import mod :except [x])` → `prim_import_except(mk_sym("mod"), ...)`
    - `(import (mod :only [a b]))` → nested form (same semantics)
    - `(:import (mod :as m))` → inside defmodule

## Review Directive

**All newly implemented features must be marked with `[DONE] (Review Needed)` until explicitly approved by the user.**
- When an agent completes implementing a feature, mark it `[DONE] (Review Needed)` (not `[DONE]`)
- If a feature is blocked, mark it `[BLOCKED]` with a reason
- `[DONE] (Review Needed)` means: code is written and working, but awaits user review/approval
- After user approval, move completed tasks to `TODO_COMPLETED.md`
- Workflow: `[TODO]` → implement → `[DONE] (Review Needed)` → user approves → move to archive

---

## Global Directives (Read First)

### Repo Root + Path Discipline

**Do not assume an absolute clone path.** All paths are **repo-relative**.

When writing or running verification commands:
- Prefer: `REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` then use `"$REPO_ROOT/..."`
- Prefer `rg -n "pattern" path/` over `ls ... | grep ...`
- Prefer `find path -name 'pattern'` over `ls | grep` for existence checks

### Transmigration Directive (Non-Negotiable)

**Correctness invariant:** For every in-region heap object `src` reached during transmigration, `remap(src)` yields exactly one stable destination `dst`, and all pointer discovery/rewrites happen only via metadata-driven `clone/trace`.

**Do not bypass the metadata-driven transmigration machinery for "fast paths".**

### Issue Authoring Directive

- **Append-only numbering:** Never renumber existing issues
- **No duplicates:** One header per issue number
- **Status required:** Every task line must be `[TODO]`, `[IN_PROGRESS]`, `[DONE] (Review Needed)`, `[BLOCKED]`, or `[N/A]`

### Code-to-TODO Directive (Non-Negotiable)

**All in-code notes must become tracked items in TODO.md.**

When encountering ANY of the following in source code:
- `// TODO:` or `/* TODO */` comments
- `// FIXME:` or `/* FIXME */` comments
- `// HACK:` or `// XXX:` comments
- `// NOTE:` comments describing unfinished work
- Stub implementations (functions that return placeholder values)
- Unimplemented branches (e.g., `else { /* not yet implemented */ }`)
- Feature flags or `#ifdef` blocks for incomplete features

**Required action:**
1. Create a concrete `[TODO]` item in TODO.md under the appropriate Issue
2. Include: file path, line number, and clear description of what needs to be done
3. Remove or update the in-code comment to reference the TODO.md item
4. Example: `// TODO(I27-p0): see TODO.md Issue 27 P0`

**Rationale:** Scattered in-code TODOs are invisible to project tracking. Centralizing them in TODO.md ensures nothing is forgotten and enables proper prioritization.

### Jujutsu Commit Directive

**Use Jujutsu (jj) for ALL version control operations.**

Before beginning ANY implementation subtask:
1. Run `jj describe -m "Issue N: task description"`
2. Run `jj log` to see current state
3. If mismatch: Either `jj squash` to consolidate or `jj new` to start fresh

---

## Design Decisions

### Data Structure Simplification (2026-01-15)

**Decision:** OmniLisp uses exactly **3 core collection types**:

| Type | Syntax | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **List** | `(1 2 3)` | Cons cells, code representation, recursive processing |
| **Array** | `[1 2 3]` | Mutable, indexed access, general sequences |
| **Dict** | `#{:a 1 :b 2}` | Key-value storage, structured data |

**Deprecated types** (runtime support retained for backward compatibility):
- **Tuple** → Use arrays instead (same semantics, simpler model)
- **Named Tuple** → Use dicts instead (`:key value` pairs)
- **Alist/Plist** → Use dicts instead (unified key-value abstraction)

**Rationale:**
1. Tuples provide no semantic benefit over arrays in a Region-RC model
2. Named tuples are just dicts with ordered iteration (dicts suffice)
3. Alists/Plists are legacy Lisp patterns; dicts are more intuitive
4. Fewer types = simpler mental model, consistent destructuring syntax
5. No immutability notation needed: Region-RC handles mutation safety at region boundaries

**Documentation updated:**
- `docs/SYNTAX.md` - Collection syntax
- `language_reference.md` - Destructuring patterns, type examples
- `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Let destructuring
- `docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md` - Character Calculus table, variance examples
- `docs/LANGUAGE_COMPLETENESS_REPORT.md` - Data types status

**Runtime deprecation:**
- `mk_tuple()`, `mk_tuple_region()` - marked deprecated
- `mk_named_tuple()`, `mk_named_tuple_region()` - marked deprecated
- `print_tuple()`, `print_named_tuple()` - marked deprecated

## Issue 1: Adopt "RC external pointers" semantics as Region-RC spec cross-check [DONE] (Review Needed)

**Objective:** Cross-check OmniLisp's per-region reference counting model against the RC dialect's definition of "external pointers".

**Reference (read first):**
- `runtime/docs/MEMORY_TERMINOLOGY.md`
- `docs/CTRR.md`

### P2: External RC Insertion [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] Label: I1-ctrr-external-rc-insertion (P2)
  Objective: Implement external reference counting at region boundaries.
  Where: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c`, `csrc/codegen/region_codegen.c`
  Why: Required for correct cross-region reference management.
  What was done:
    1. Type-based strategy selection in `omni_choose_escape_repair_strategy()`:
       - Small fixed-size types (int, float, pair, symbol): TRANSMIGRATE
       - Large/variable-size types (array, string, dict, closure): RETAIN_REGION
       - Environment variable override: OMNILISP_REPAIR_STRATEGY=retain|transmigrate
    2. `omni_codegen_escape_repair()` emits retain or transmigrate at return points
    3. `omni_codegen_emit_region_releases_at_pos()` emits release at last-use
    4. Full integration wired into `codegen_define()` and lambda codegen
  Verification: All 4 tests pass in `test_codegen_region_retain_release`

### RF: Regression Fix

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I1-transmigrate-external-root-identity-regression (RF-I1-1)
  - Fixed root identity regression in transmigration

---

## Issue 6: Parser Syntax Completion (Align SYNTAX.md with Implementation) [DONE] (Review Needed)

**Objective:** Implement missing parser features documented in SYNTAX.md.

**Reference (read first):**
- `docs/SYNTAX.md` (Implementation Status section)
- `csrc/parser/parser.c`

### P0: Implement Dict Literal Parsing `#{}` [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] APPROVED Label: I6-p0-dict-literals
  Objective: Parse `#{:a 1 :b 2}` as dictionary literal.
  Review Status: SOUND - Implementation is correct
  Where: `csrc/parser/parser.c`
  Why: Documented syntax but no parser rule exists.
  What was done:
    1. Added `R_DICT` rule matching `#{` ... `}`
    2. Parse key-value pairs (alternating symbols and expressions)
    3. Return `OMNI_DICT` AST node
  Verification:
    - Add test: `#{:a 1}` parses to dict with key 'a value 1
    - Run: `make -C csrc/tests test`

### P1: Implement Signed Integer Parsing `+456` [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] APPROVED Label: I6-p1-signed-integers
  Objective: Parse `+456` as positive integer literal.
  Review Status: SOUND - Implementation is correct
  Where: `csrc/parser/parser.c`
  Why: Currently `+` parsed as symbol, not sign.
  What was done:
    1. Modified `R_INT` to optionally accept leading `+` or `-`
    2. Ensured `-123` and `+456` both parse as integers
  Verification:
    - Add test: `+456` parses to integer 456
    - Add test: `-123` parses to integer -123
    - Run: `make -C csrc/tests test`

### P2: Implement Partial Float Parsing `.5`, `3.` [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] APPROVED Label: I6-p2-partial-floats
  Objective: Parse `.5` and `3.` as float literals.
  Review Status: SOUND - Implementation is correct
  Where: `csrc/parser/parser.c`
  Why: Current parser requires `INT.INT` format.
  What was done:
    1. Updated `R_FLOAT` to accept `.DIGITS` and `DIGITS.`
    2. Handle edge cases (`.` alone should not be float)
  Verification:
    - Add test: `.5` parses to float 0.5
    - Add test: `3.` parses to float 3.0
    - Run: `make -C csrc/tests test`

### P3: Complete Match Clause Parsing [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] APPROVED Label: I6-p3-match-clauses
  Objective: Parse `[pattern result]` and `[pattern :when guard result]` match clauses.
  Where: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c`, `runtime/include/omni.h`
  Review Status: SOUND - Implementation is correct
  What was done:
    1. Updated `codegen_match` to detect array-based clause syntax
    2. Extract pattern from array[0], result from array[1]
    3. Detect `:when` keyword at array[1] for guarded clauses
    4. Added `is_pattern_match` declaration to omni.h
    5. Both new syntax `[pattern result]` and legacy syntax work
  Verification:
    - Test: `(match x [1 "one"])` → works
    - Test: `(match x [n :when (> n 0) "positive"])` → works
    - Test file: `tests/test_match_clauses.lisp` - all 6 tests pass

### P4: Make Signed Numbers Lexical (Not Symbolic) [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] APPROVED Label: I6-p4-lexical-signed-numbers
  Objective: Treat signed numbers as lexical atoms, not applications of `-`/`+` operator.
  Review Status: SOUND - Implementation is correct
  Where: `csrc/parser/parser.c`
  What was done (2026-01-17):
    1. Added new rule IDs: R_OPT_SIGN, R_OPT_INT, R_FLOAT_FULL, R_FLOAT_LEAD, R_FLOAT_TRAIL, R_ANY_FLOAT
    2. Implemented R_FLOAT_FULL: SIGN? INT "." INT (e.g., -3.14, +2.5)
    3. Implemented R_FLOAT_LEAD: SIGN? "." INT (e.g., .5, -.25)
    4. Implemented R_FLOAT_TRAIL: SIGN? INT "." (e.g., 3., -5.)
    5. R_ANY_FLOAT combines all float forms in correct precedence order
    6. Updated R_EXPR to use R_ANY_FLOAT instead of R_FLOAT
    7. R_SIGNED_INT already handled signed integers correctly
  Verification:
    - `-123` → `mk_int(-123)` ✓
    - `-3.14` → `mk_float_region(_local_region, -3.140000)` ✓
    - `.5` → `mk_float_region(_local_region, 0.500000)` ✓
    - `3.` → `mk_float_region(_local_region, 3.000000)` ✓
    - `-.25` → `mk_float_region(_local_region, -0.250000)` ✓
    - `(+ -10 5)` → `prim_add(mk_int(-10), mk_int(5))` ✓

### P5: Value Type Literals `{value}` [PARTIAL] (2026-01-18)

- [PARTIAL] Label: I6-p5-value-type-literals
  Objective: Allow literal values in braces `{3}` to be value types (not just types).
  Where: `csrc/parser/parser.c` (lines 397-421), `csrc/codegen/codegen.c` (lines 5344-5356)
  What was done:
    1. Extended `act_type()` parser function to detect literal values inside braces
    2. Implemented pragmatic mapping: `{3}`→{Int}, `{true}`→{Bool}, `{"hello"}`→{String}, etc.
    3. Added special handling for `value->type` primitive in codegen to avoid symbol mangling
    4. Value type literals now compile and run correctly
  Limitations:
    - Current implementation maps value types to their runtime types (pragmatic, not full value types)
    - Type checking doesn't enforce refinement: `(define x {3} 4)` compiles (should fail)
    - No pattern matching support for value types: `[{3} "three"]` not yet implemented
    - Full implementation requires value type system support in compiler (future work)
  Verification:
    - ✓ All literal types compile: `{3}`, `{true}`, `{false}`, `{"hello"}`, `{nil}`, `{#\a}`, `{1.5}`
    - ✓ Type annotations work: `(define x {3} 42)` compiles
    - ✓ Backwards compatible: Existing type annotations `{Int}`, `{String}` continue to work
    - See `ISSUE6_P5_VALUE_TYPE_LITERALS.md` for detailed documentation
  Future Work (requires deeper compiler changes):
    - Implement proper value type representation in AST
    - Add Type.from_value() or equivalent for compile-time type computation
    - Implement refinement type checking to enforce {3} only accepts value 3
    - Support value type patterns in match expressions
    - Integrate with parametric types: `{Option [{3}]}`
  Note: Related to Julia's value types and refinement types.

### P6: Unify Define Forms to Slot Syntax [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] Label: I6-p6-define-slot-syntax
  Objective: Eliminate non-canonical define forms; require all parameters to use slot syntax `[]`.
  Where: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c`
  What was done:
    1. Canonical slot syntax works: `(define add [x] [y] (+ x y))` → compiles correctly
    2. Shorthand sugar works: `(define add x y (+ x y))` → treated identically
    3. Scheme-style rejected: `(define (add x y) ...)` → error with helpful message:
       ```
       Error: Scheme-style (define (add ...) body) syntax is not supported.
              Use OmniLisp Slot syntax instead:
                (define add [x] [y] body)   ; Canonical
                (define add x y body)       ; Shorthand
       ```
    4. `codegen_extract_param_name()` handles both `x` and `[x]` uniformly
  Verification: Tested all three forms - canonical works, shorthand works, Scheme-style errors.
  Note: Slot syntax enables uniform destructuring: `(define foo [[x y] z] ...)`.

## Issue 9: Feature Completion: Algebraic Effects, Continuations, and Typed Arrays [DONE] (Review Needed)

**Objective:** Implement missing core functionality in the Algebraic Effect system, Fiber/Continuation system, and Typed Arrays.

**Completed:** 2026-01-17

**IMPORTANT Design Decision (2026-01-14):**
- `try`/`catch` is **NOT supported** in OmniLisp
- Error handling uses **algebraic effects** instead (see `SYNTAX_REVISION.md` Section 7)
- Algebraic effects are implemented using **delimited continuations** (shift/reset style)
- `handle` installs a prompt; effect operations capture continuation to handler
- Handlers can resume, discard, or invoke multiple times the captured continuation

**Reference (read first):**
- `docs/SYNTAX_REVISION.md` (Section 7: Algebraic Effects)
- `DISCONNECTED_EDGES_ANALYSIS.md` (Sections 2, 6.1, 6.3, 6.4)
- `runtime/src/effect.c`
- `runtime/src/memory/continuation.c`

**Constraints:**
- `try`/`catch` syntax is explicitly NOT supported
- Must satisfy existing test stubs in `runtime/tests`

    4. Implemented `effect_trace_record()` - records effect with timestamp
    5. Implemented `effect_trace_clear()` - clears trace buffer
    6. Added `effect_trace_mark_handled()` and `effect_trace_last_index()` helpers
  Verification: `runtime/tests/test_effect_tracing.c` passes (10 tests).

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I9-t5-fiber-callbacks
  Objective: Fiber callback execution (on_fulfill, on_reject) and error handling.
  Where: `runtime/src/memory/continuation.c`
  What was done:
    1. `promise_resolve()` calls `on_fulfill` callbacks (line 1310-1316)
    2. `promise_reject()` calls `on_reject` callbacks (line 1341-1354)
    3. `promise_then()` registers callbacks for settled/pending promises

    2. Implemented `omni_typed_array_filter()` - filters elements by predicate
    3. Implemented `omni_typed_array_reduce()` - reduces array with accumulator
    4. Fixed memory leak in `omni_typed_array_create` allocation failure paths
    5. Fixed incorrect list construction in `omni_typed_array_to_list`
  Additional bugs fixed:
    - Changed malloc/calloc to region_alloc for CTRR integration
    - Fixed list building bug where each cell's cdr was NULL instead of linked
  Verification: See `TYPED_ARRAY_FIXES.md` for detailed bug analysis

### P2: Algebraic Effects Compiler Support [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I9-p2-effect-declaration
  Objective: Parse `{effect Name}` as effect type declaration.
  Where: `runtime/src/effect.c`

    1. Built-in effects registered: Fail, Ask, Emit, State, Yield, Async, Choice, Condition
    2. `prim_effect_type_register()` allows registering custom effects from Lisp
    3. `effect_type_find()` / `effect_type_find_by_id()` for lookup
  Note: Parser support for `{effect ...}` syntax can be added later as sugar.
  Verification: `runtime/tests/test_effect.c` passes (22 tests).

- [DONE] APPROVED Label: I9-p2-handle-form
  Objective: Implement `handle` as special form in compiler.
  Where: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c`, `runtime/src/effect.c`
  Review Status: SOUND - Implementation is correct
  What was done (via Issue 14 P2):
    1. Added `handle` to special form detection in codegen
    2. `codegen_handler_closure` generates static handler functions
    3. `codegen_body_thunk` generates closure for handle body
    4. Emits `effect_handle(_body_thunk, _h_clauses, _h_return_clause, NULL)`
    5. Handler closures receive (payload, resume) args and can call `prim_resume`
  IMPORTANT: Built-in `Fail` effect is RECOVERY_ABORT mode (can't resume).
             Use custom effect names for resumable effects.
  Verification: ✓ 7 effect tests pass (see tests/test_effects.lisp)
    - Test 1: No effect (body returns 3)
    - Test 2: Perform+resume (1+42=43)
    - Test 5: Chained ops (5+10=15)
    - Test 6: Payload use (5*2=10)
    - Test 7: Nested expr (2*(3+5)=16)

  Where: `runtime/src/condition.c`, `runtime/src/condition.h`, `runtime/src/effect.c`
  What was done:
    1. Added `TAG_CONDITION` to omni.h for Obj-wrapped conditions
    2. Added `EFFECT_CONDITION` built-in effect type (RECOVERY_ONE_SHOT mode)
    3. Implemented `mk_condition_obj()` - wraps Condition in Obj with TAG_CONDITION
    4. Implemented `condition_signal()` - performs EFFECT_CONDITION (resumable)
    5. Implemented `condition_error()` - performs EFFECT_FAIL (non-resumable)
    6. Implemented `condition_signal_with_message()` - convenience wrapper
    7. Implemented `condition_from_obj()` - extracts Condition from Obj
  Design: Adapter approach - preserves condition type hierarchy but uses effects
         for signaling. Handlers using `handle` form can catch condition effects.
  Note: Lisp-level `signal`, `handler-case`, `restart-case` require separate codegen work.

### P3: Iterator-Generator Integration [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I14-p3-iterator-generator
  Objective: Implement iterators using generator continuations.

    2. Implemented `mk_generator_obj()` in continuation.c - wraps Generator in Obj
    3. Added generator-based iterator functions to iterator.c:
       - `prim_make_generator(producer)` - create generator from closure
       - `prim_generator_next(gen)` - get next value using `generator_next`
       - `prim_generator_done(gen)` - check if generator exhausted
       - `prim_yield(value)` - yield value from within generator
       - `is_generator(obj)` - helper to check if Obj is a generator
       - `prim_iter_next_unified(iter)` - supports both pair and generator iterators
       - `prim_take_unified(n, seq)` - supports both pair and generator sequences
  Design: Existing pair-based iterators preserved for backwards compatibility.
          Generator-based iteration uses delimited continuations for suspend/resume.
  Note: Lisp codegen for `make-generator` and `yield` forms needs separate work.

    4. Added `act_kind_splice()` action function in parser.c:385-409
    5. Added `codegen_kind_splice()` in codegen.c:1968-2051 with compile-time evaluation
    6. Grammar: TYPE = KIND_SPLICE / TYPE_NORMAL (priority alt)
  Compile-time evaluation:
    - Literal integers: `{#kind (typeof 42)}` → `mk_kind("Int", NULL, 0)`
    - Literal strings: `{#kind (typeof "hi")}` → `mk_kind("String", NULL, 0)`
    - Literal floats: `{#kind (typeof 3.14)}` → `mk_kind("Float", NULL, 0)`
    - Symbols: `{#kind Int}` → `mk_kind("Int", NULL, 0)`

    3. Updated `prim_eq()` in runtime.c:1774-1776:
       - Added TAG_KIND case using `kind_values_equal()`
    4. Added declaration in omni.h:756:
       - `Obj* prim_kind_eq(Obj* a, Obj* b);`
    5. Added codegen mapping in codegen.c:1491:
       - `"kind=?"` → `prim_kind_eq`
  Verification:

## Issue 21: Promise Release Cancellation Fix [DONE] (Review Needed)

**Objective:** Fix improper cancellation of waiting fibers when a promise is released before fulfillment.

**Completed:** 2026-01-18

**Bug Location:** `runtime/src/memory/continuation.c:1443`

**Reference:**
- See `PROMISE_RELEASE_FIX.md` for detailed analysis

### P0: Fix promise_release to properly unpark waiting fibers [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I21-p0-unpark-waiters
  Objective: Properly unpark waiting fibers instead of just marking them FIBER_DONE.
  Where: `runtime/src/memory/continuation.c:1439-1453`
  What was done:
    1. Replaced simple state change with proper `fiber_unpark_error()` calls
    2. Each waiting fiber is unparked with error state (is_error=true, value=NULL)
    3. Cleared waiters list to prevent accessing freed fibers
    4. Added explanatory comments about fix behavior
  Before (buggy code):
    ```c
    /* Cancel waiting tasks */
    Fiber* t = p->waiters;
    while (t) {
        Fiber* next = t->next;
        t->state = FIBER_DONE;  /* TODO: Better cancellation */
        t = next;
    }
    free(p);
    ```
  After (fixed code):
    ```c
    /* Cancel waiting tasks by unparking them with error */
    Fiber* t = p->waiters;
    while (t) {
        Fiber* next = t->next;
        /* Unpark fiber with error indicating promise was destroyed/cancelled */
        /* fiber_unpark_error will enqueue fiber and set state to FIBER_READY */
        fiber_unpark_error(t, NULL, true);
        t = next;
    }
    /* Clear waiters list to prevent accessing freed fibers */
    p->waiters = NULL;
    free(p);
    ```
  Bug Impact:
    - Fibers waiting on a released promise were left stuck in `FIBER_PARKED` state
    - They remained in the promise's waiters list indefinitely
    - Never scheduled to run again → potential deadlocks
    - Memory leaks from fibers never completing
  Fix Behavior:
    - All waiting fibers are properly unparked with error state
    - `fiber_unpark_error()` enqueues fibers (sets state to `FIBER_READY`)
    - Fibers are scheduled to run and can handle the error (promise destroyed)
    - Waiters list is cleared before freeing promise
  Verification: Runtime builds successfully. All 397 tests pass. Fix addresses TODO comment "Better cancellation".
  Test Fix (2026-01-18):
  - Added `scheduler_init()` call to `test_promise_release_unparks_waiters()`
  - Test creates stack-allocated fibers that need scheduler for unparking
  - Without scheduler_init(), `scheduler_enqueue()` returns early without changing fiber state
  - Fix ensures test properly validates to Issue 21 runtime fix
  - Note: Not calling `scheduler_shutdown()` because fibers are stack-allocated

### P1: Optimize Conversion Functions [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] (Review Needed) Label: I22-p1-optimize-conversions
  Objective: Replace switch statements with simple arithmetic operations.
  Where: `runtime/src/memory/region_value.c`, `runtime/src/memory/transmigrate.c`
  What was done:
    1. `type_id_to_tag()` - Changed from 18-case switch to `return type_id + 1`
    2. `tag_to_type_id()` - Changed from 19-case switch to `return tag - 1`
    3. `transmigrate_tag_to_type_id()` - Changed from 24-case switch to fast path + special cases
    4. All functions marked `inline` for better optimization
  Verification: Functions compile and work correctly. ✓

### Benefits

1. **Performance:** Eliminates 61 case statements, replaced with O(1) arithmetic
2. **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for enum order
3. **Binary Size:** Reduced by eliminating ~60 case branches
4. **Type Safety:** Compile-time arithmetic instead of runtime switches

## Issue 23: Perceus Reuse & Lobster RC Elision Integration [DONE] (Review Needed)

**Objective:** Wire existing Perceus-style reuse analysis and Lobster-style RC elision from analysis passes into code generation.

**Priority:** HIGH - Major performance optimization (30-50% fewer RC ops, near-zero alloc for functional patterns).

**Completed:** 2026-01-18

**Reference:**
- `FUTURE_WORK.md` (O.1 and O.2 now marked INTEGRATED)
- Perceus: Garbage Free Reference Counting with Reuse (PLDI 2021)
- Lobster: aardappel.github.io/lobster/memory_management.html

### Background

The analysis infrastructure was already complete:
- `csrc/analysis/analysis.c`: `omni_analyze_reuse()` finds free→alloc pairs
- `csrc/analysis/analysis.c`: `omni_analyze_rc_elision()` determines RC elision class
- `csrc/analysis/analysis.h`: `ReuseCandidate`, `RCElisionClass` types

What was missing: **codegen integration** - analysis results were computed but ignored.

### P0: Perceus Reuse Codegen Integration [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] APPROVED Label: I23-p0-reuse-integration
  Objective: Use reuse analysis results during code generation.
  Review Status: SOUND - Implementation is correct
  Where: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c:280-423`
  What was done:
    1. Added `codegen_get_reuse()` - query reuse candidates at current position
    2. Added `codegen_emit_reuse_int()` - emit `REUSE_OR_NEW_INT` if candidate found
    3. Added `codegen_emit_reuse_float()` - emit `REUSE_OR_NEW_FLOAT` if candidate found
    4. Added `codegen_emit_reuse_cell()` - emit `REUSE_OR_NEW_CELL` if candidate found
    5. Updated `codegen_int()` and `codegen_float()` to check for reuse opportunities
    6. Added `omni_consume_reuse()` declaration to `analysis.h`
  Generated code transformation:
  ```c
  // Before (fresh allocation)
  Obj* y = mk_int(42);

  // After (reusing x's memory when analysis finds a candidate)
  Obj* y = REUSE_OR_NEW_INT(_local_region, x, 42);
  ```
    4. Added `codegen_emit_reuse_cell()` - emit `REUSE_OR_NEW_CELL` if candidate found
    5. Updated `codegen_int()` and `codegen_float()` to check for reuse opportunities
    6. Added `omni_consume_reuse()` declaration to `analysis.h`
  Generated code transformation:
  ```c
  // Before (fresh allocation)
  Obj* y = mk_int(42);

  // After (reusing x's memory when analysis finds a candidate)
  Obj* y = REUSE_OR_NEW_INT(_local_region, x, 42);
  ```

### P1: Lobster RC Elision Codegen Integration [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] APPROVED Label: I23-p1-rc-elision-integration
  Objective: Use RC elision analysis results to skip redundant inc_ref/dec_ref.
  Review Status: SOUND - Implementation is correct
  Where: `csrc/codegen/codegen.c:402-423, 5820-5852, 5999-6029, 6543-6551`
  What was done:

    2. Added `codegen_get_elision_class()` - get elision class for comments
    3. Added `codegen_emit_dec_ref()` / `codegen_emit_inc_ref()` - emit with elision check
    4. Updated `emit_ownership_free()` RC cases to check elision
    5. Updated `omni_codegen_emit_cfg_frees()` RC cases to check elision
    6. Updated scope cleanup code to check elision
  Generated code transformation:
  ```c
  // Before (unconditional RC)
  dec_ref(x);

  // After (elision when analysis proves safe)
  /* RC_ELIDED: dec_ref(x) - unique */
  ```

### Elision Classes

| Class | When Applied | Effect |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| `RC_ELIDE_BOTH` | Unique or stack-allocated | Skip both inc_ref and dec_ref |
| `RC_ELIDE_DEC` | Arena/pool-allocated | Skip dec_ref (bulk free) |
| `RC_ELIDE_INC` | Borrowed reference | Skip inc_ref (don't own it) |
| `RC_REQUIRED` | Shared heap reference | Must use RC |

### Expected Impact

- **RC Elision (O.1):** 30-50% reduction in RC operations for typical code
- **Reuse (O.2):** Near-zero allocation for functional patterns (e.g., map, fold)

  Fixed: Test file `test_region_rc_liveness.c` updated and passing (4/4 tests)

### P4: Test Fixes [DONE]

- [DONE] Label: I29-p4-tests
  Objective: Fix test issues and enable stubbed tests.
  Items:
    1. `tests/test_pika_tower.c:464` - [FIXED] Pika charset escaped caret now works correctly.
       The original test file uses a deprecated 2-arg API that no longer exists.
       New test file `runtime/tests/test_pika_charset.c` verifies all charset escape sequences work:
       - `[\^]+` matches `^^^` ✓
       - `[a\^b]+` matches `a^b^a` ✓
       - `[\]]+` matches `]]]` ✓

- [DEPRECATED] Label: I29-p5-parser
  Objective: Complete parser implementation.
  Items:
    1. `csrc/parser/parser.c:582` - [NOT_NEEDED] Match clause semantic action is part of unused R_MATCH_CLAUSE rule.
       Match expressions are parsed through regular R_LIST and handled by codegen_match().
       The dedicated match grammar rules (R_MATCH, R_MATCH_CLAUSE, R_MATCH_CLAUSES) were defined but never wired up.
       Fixed: codegen_match now supports list-based clauses (pattern result) in addition to array-based [pattern result].

# Historical Backup: 2026-01-10 (Early Development)

# OmniLisp TODO (Restarted)

This TODO list was **restarted on 2026-01-10** after archiving the previous historical backlog.

Backup of the previous `TODO.md` (full history):
- `TODO_ARCHIVE/TODO.md.backup.2026-01-10_120111`

## Review Directive

**All newly implemented features must be marked with `[DONE]` (Review Needed) until explicitly approved by the user.**

- When an agent completes implementing a feature, mark it `[DONE]` (not `[DONE]`)
- `[DONE]` means: code is written and working, but awaits user review/approval
- After user approval, change `[DONE]` to `[DONE]`
- Workflow: `[TODO]` → implement → `[DONE]` → user approves → `[DONE]`

---

## Transmigration Directive (Non-Negotiable)

**Correctness invariant (must always hold):** For every in-region heap object `src` reached during transmigration, `remap(src)` yields exactly one stable destination `dst`, and all pointer discovery/rewrites happen only via metadata-driven `clone/trace` (no ad-hoc shape walkers); external/non-region pointers are treated as roots and never rewritten.

**Do not bypass the metadata-driven transmigration machinery for “fast paths”.**

Rationale:
- Fast paths that “special-case” one shape (e.g., linear lists) tend to reintroduce unsoundness by silently skipping necessary escape repair (Region Closure Property).
- CTRR’s guarantee requires a *single* authoritative escape repair mechanism (metadata-driven `clone/trace`), with optimizations implemented **inside** that machinery (remap/forwarding strategy, worklist layout/chunking, batch allocation, dispatch reductions, etc.), not around it.

Minimal “stay on the path” examples:

Allowed (optimize inside the existing machinery):
```c
// GOOD: still uses the same remap + metadata callbacks.
Obj *dst = omni_remap_get_or_clone(ctx, src, meta);   // may use dense tables / forwarding
meta->trace(ctx, dst, src);                           // discovers edges via metadata
// ...ctx pushes work items; loop processes them...
```

Forbidden (bypass/alternate implementations):
```c
// BAD: special-cases a shape and bypasses metadata-driven trace/clone.
if (omni_is_linear_list(src)) {
  return omni_fast_copy_list_without_metadata(src, dst_region);
}
```

Allowed:
- Optimization of the existing transmigration loop and remap/worklist internals.
- Type-specific micro-optimizations that are implemented via metadata callbacks and remain fully covered by the same correctness tests.
- Instrumentation/metrics that prove a change is a *true* win (e.g., worklist push/pop counts, visitor-call counts, forwarding hit rate), without changing the correctness contract.

Forbidden:
- Any separate “alternate transmigrate implementation” that bypasses metadata clone/trace for a subset of graphs unless it is proven equivalent and treated as part of the same contract (and reviewed as a high-risk change).

---

## Issue Authoring Directive (Agent-Proof)

This file uses **Issue N** enumeration (starting at 1). Do not renumber existing issues.

Rules (mandatory):
- **Append-only numbering:** When creating a new issue, add it as `## Issue N: ...` using the next available integer `N`. Never renumber existing issues.
- **No duplicates:** There must be exactly one header for each issue number. If an issue needs revision, append an “Amendment” subsection inside that issue instead of creating a second copy elsewhere.
- **Dependency order:** Issues must be ordered top-to-bottom by dependency.
- **Status required:** Every task line must be one of `[TODO]`, `[IN_PROGRESS]`, `[DONE]`, or `[N/A]` with a one-line reason for `[N/A]`. Never delete old tasks; mark them `[N/A]` instead.
- **Benchmark consistency clause (perf tasks):** Any performance-related issue MUST define a reproducible benchmark protocol (compiler + flags, rebuild steps, warmup/repeats, and what to report). If the protocol is not specified, the issue is incomplete and must be marked `[N/A]` until fixed.

Required “agent-proof” structure for new issues/tasks:
- **Objective:** 1–2 sentences describing the concrete outcome.
- **Reference (read first):** exact doc paths that explain the theory/contract.
- **Constraints:** restate “no stop-the-world GC”, “no language-visible share”, and issue-specific invariants.
- **Subtasks:** each subtask must include:
  - **Label:** short, unique, grep-able (e.g. `I1-rc-crosscheck`).
  - **Where:** exact file paths to modify.
  - **Why:** architectural reason; what breaks or is slow today.
  - **What to change:** numbered steps.
  - **Implementation details:** include pseudocode and key structs/functions/macros.
  - **Verification plan:** concrete tests + exact commands.

---

## Jujutsu Commit Directive (MANDATORY)

**Use Jujutsu (jj) for ALL version control operations.**

### Pre-Task Checklist (MANDATORY)

**Before beginning ANY implementation subtask, you MUST:**

1. **Run `jj describe -m "sample message here"`** to save the current working state
1. **Run `jj log`** to see the current working state
2. **Read the description** to understand what changes are in progress
3. **Confirm alignment** with the task you're about to implement
4. **If mismatch**: Either `jj squash` to consolidate or `jj new` to start fresh

```bash
# ALWAYS run this first
jj describe
```

### Commit Workflow

- **Use jj (not git)**: All commits must be made using `jj` commands
- **Squash workflow**: Use `jj squash` to combine related changes before committing
- **For every completed task:**
  - Create a dedicated jujutsu squash with a clear, imperative message.

## Issue 1: Adopt “RC external pointers” semantics as Region‑RC spec cross-check (Internet-Informed 11.1) [TODO]

**Objective:** Cross-check OmniLisp’s per-region reference counting model against the RC dialect’s definition of “external pointers”, then encode the applicable semantics as explicit OmniLisp docs and verification checklists (no language-visible API changes).

**Reference (read first):**
- `review_todo.md` (Issue 11.1 and Issue 1/2 model tasks)
- `docs/CTRR.md` (Region Closure Property; “everything can escape”)
- `runtime/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (model naming and boundaries)
- RC dialect overview: https://www.barnowl.org/research/rc/index.html

**Constraints (non-negotiable):**
- No stop-the-world GC; no heap-wide scanning collectors.
- No language-visible “share primitive” (`(share v)` is forbidden).
- No programmer-visible RC APIs (we use CTRR insertion + runtime barriers).
- The runtime contract must be “always safe”; debug aborts may exist as diagnostics only, not as the semantic contract.

### P0: Write the Region‑RC model spec (external pointers, liveness, invariants) [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] Label: I1-region-rc-model-doc (P0)
  Objective: Create a single authoritative doc defining Region‑RC and "external pointer" semantics in OmniLisp terms.
  Where:
    - Add: `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md` ✅
    - Update: `runtime/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (link + terminology alignment) ✅
  Why:
    "Per-region RC" is ambiguous unless we explicitly define what increments/decrements region external refs and what it means for safe reclamation.
  What to write:
    1. Region liveness rule:
       - Alive iff `scope_alive == true || external_rc > 0`.
       - Reclaimable iff `scope_alive == false && external_rc == 0`.
    2. Definition of "external pointer / external reference":
       - in OmniLisp: pointers into region `R` stored *outside `R`* in a way that can outlive `R` (older region, global, other thread, etc.).
    3. Relationship to transmigration:
       - transmigrate repairs escape edges so Region Closure holds (no pointers into dead regions).
    4. Relationship to mutation auto-repair (Issue 2 tasks are in `review_todo.md`):
       - illegal younger→older stores must be repaired (copy or merge) so the model stays sound without GC.
  Verification plan:
    - Doc includes a "Conformance Checklist" referencing:
      - "external-root non-rewrite rule" (transmigration)
      - "mutation barrier inventory complete" (review_todo Issue 2)

- [DONE] Label: I1-external-ref-boundary-inventory (P0)
  Objective: Enumerate all runtime/compile-time "escape boundaries" that can create external references to a region.
  Where:
    - Add section: `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md` ("External reference boundaries") ✅
  Why:
    If even one boundary is missed, region external_rc becomes meaningless and reclaim can be unsafe.
  What to list (minimum categories):
    - return to caller/outliving scope ✅
    - closure capture ✅
    - global/module store ✅
    - channel send/recv (cross-thread) ✅
    - mutation store into older region containers (must auto-repair; see Issue 2 in review_todo.md) ✅
  Verification plan:
    - Provide at least one example per boundary in the doc (source + expected runtime operation). ✅

---

## Issue 2: Pool/arena practice + region accounting + auto-repair threshold tuning (Internet-Informed 11.3) [TODO]

**Objective:** Adopt “shortest-lived pool” lessons from pool-based allocators by adding region accounting and diagnostics that (a) detect retention cliffs and (b) provide deterministic inputs for the size heuristic used by auto-repair (transmigrate vs merge).

**Reference (read first):**
- `review_todo.md` Issue 6 (accounting), Issue 2 (auto-repair policy), Issue 11.3 (pool practice)
- APR pools usage guidance: https://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/user/performance/prevent.html
- ATS MemArena (freeze/thaw style): https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/10.1.x/developer-guide/internal-libraries/MemArena.en.html

**Constraints (non-negotiable):**
- No stop-the-world GC; no heap-wide scanning collectors.
- No language-visible share primitive.
- Diagnostics must be deterministic and cheap enough for debug builds.

### P0: Region accounting doc + required counters [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] Label: I2-region-accounting-doc (P0)
  Objective: Specify which counters are required per region (bytes, chunks, inline usage, peak) and how they power the size heuristic for store auto-repair.
  Where:
    - Add: `runtime/docs/REGION_ACCOUNTING.md` ✅
  Why:
    The "size heuristic" must be tunable and reproducible; region bytes/chunks are the best low-cost proxy.
  What to define:
    - `bytes_allocated_total`, `bytes_allocated_peak` ✅
    - `chunk_count`, `inline_buf_used_bytes` ✅
    - optional: `escape_repair_count` (how often this region forced repair) ✅
  Verification plan:
    - Doc includes example output format and thresholds. ✅

### P1: Retention diagnostics plan (shortest-lived pool enforcement without language changes) [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] Label: I2-retention-diagnostics-plan (P1)
  Objective: Define the diagnostics that identify "allocating into too-long-lived region" retention smells, and how they should be reported.
  Where:
    - Add section: `runtime/docs/REGION_ACCOUNTING.md` ("Retention cliffs") ✅
    - Optionally add doc: `runtime/docs/REGION_DIAGNOSTICS.md` (N/A - covered in REGION_ACCOUNTING.md)
  Why:
    Pool practice shows the #1 failure mode: memory "leaks" are often retention due to lifetime mismatch. We want the runtime to make this visible.
  What to report (examples):
    - "Region R is long-lived and received X allocations but only Y escapes; consider allocating in shorter-lived region" ✅
    - "Auto-repair triggered N times (M transmigrates, K merges); threshold tuning suggested" ✅
  Verification plan:
    - Define a toy workload and expected diagnostics output. ✅

### P2: Optional "freeze/thaw" coalesce-at-safe-point evaluation [N/A - Fragmentation not yet measured]

- [N/A] Label: I2-freeze-thaw-eval (P2)
  Objective: Evaluate whether a safe-point "coalesce/compact" step for long-lived regions (freeze/thaw style) is beneficial, without becoming a GC.
  Where:
    - Add: `runtime/docs/REGION_COALESCE_POLICY.md` (evaluation + decision)
  Why:
    It may reduce fragmentation for long-lived regions, but it increases complexity and must be justified by benchmarks.
  Constraints:
    - Only at explicit safe points (e.g., end of init), not background.
    - Only touches explicitly selected regions; no heap scanning beyond known live roots for that safe point.
  Verification plan:
    - Define a benchmark scenario and what would constitute a "win".
  **Reason for N/A:** Fragmentation impact not yet measured; defer until region accounting shows fragmentation is problematic.

## Issue 3: Non-lexical regions + splitting ideas as CTRR roadmap (Internet-Informed 11.2) [TODO]

**Objective:** Incorporate non-lexical region analysis and region splitting ideas as a CTRR roadmap to reduce the frequency and cost of runtime repairs (transmigrate/merge), without changing language syntax.

**Reference (read first):**
- `docs/CTRR.md`
- Better Static Memory Management (Aiken/Fähndrich/Levien, 1995): https://digicoll.lib.berkeley.edu/record/139069
- Region-Based Memory Management (Tofte/Talpin, 1997): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540196926139
- Spegion (ECOOP 2025): https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2025.15

**Constraints (non-negotiable):**
- No STW GC; no runtime heap scanning.
- No new language surface constructs required for users.

### P0: CTRR inference roadmap doc [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] Label: I3-ctrr-roadmap-doc (P0)
  Objective: Write a roadmap doc that maps research ideas into concrete CTRR phases OmniLisp could implement.
  Where:
    - Add: `docs/CTRR_REGION_INFERENCE_ROADMAP.md` ✅
  Why:
    Compiler improvements reduce runtime repair pressure and improve robustness (fewer opportunities for dynamic lifetime changes).
  What to include:
    - Non-lexical region ends (liveness-driven end-of-region insertion) ✅
    - Allocate-into-outliving-region when escape is provable (avoid transmigrate) ✅
    - Internal "splittable regions" representation (to support later merges without copying) ✅
    - Interaction with mutation auto-repair policy (Issue 2 in review_todo.md) ✅
  Verification plan:
    - Provide 3 pseudo-programs with "expected region plan" (where regions start/end; where transmigrate would be inserted). ✅

---

## Issue 4: Concurrency SMR techniques for internal runtime DS (QSBR first; alternatives documented) (Internet-Informed 11.4) [TODO]

**Objective:** Evaluate safe memory reclamation (SMR) techniques (QSBR/Userspace RCU first) for *internal runtime data structures* (metadata registries, intern tables), improving concurrency and tooling robustness without turning the heap into a GC-managed space.

**Reference (read first):**
- `review_todo.md` Issue 11.4 tasks
- liburcu (Userspace RCU): https://liburcu.org/
- QSBR overview: https://lwn.net/Articles/573424/
- `runtime/docs/REGION_THREADING_MODEL.md` (to be written; threading contract)

**Constraints (non-negotiable):**
- Not a heap GC: SMR applies only to internal runtime DS nodes.
- No STW “scan and collect”.
- Must align with the threading/ownership contract (documented first).

### P0: SMR target inventory + decision matrix [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] Label: I4-smr-target-inventory (P0)
  Objective: Identify which internal runtime structures would benefit from SMR and create a decision matrix (QSBR vs lock vs hazard-pointer family).
  Where:
    - Add: `runtime/docs/SMR_FOR_RUNTIME_STRUCTURES.md` ✅
  Why:
    Adopting SMR without a clear target is complexity without payoff. We must start with concrete structures.
  What to include:
    - List candidate structures (e.g., metadata registry, intern table, global module map). ✅
    - For each, note read/write ratio, expected contention, and preferred approach. ✅
  Verification plan:
    - Include a microbenchmark plan for one structure (not the heap) following the benchmark protocol clause. ✅

### P1: QSBR mapping to OmniLisp "quiescent points" [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] Label: I4-qsbr-quiescent-points (P1)
  Objective: Define where quiescent states would be reported in OmniLisp (end of bytecode step, end of tether window, safe points), and how that interacts with region ownership.
  Where:
    - `runtime/docs/SMR_FOR_RUNTIME_STRUCTURES.md` (QSBR design) ✅
    - `runtime/docs/REGION_THREADING_MODEL.md` (tie-in) ✅
  Verification plan:
    - Provide at least one concurrency scenario (reader/writer) and explain when reclamation is permitted. ✅

### P2: Alternatives review (hazard pointers / Hyaline / publish-on-ping) [DONE] (Review Needed)

- [DONE] Label: I4-alternatives-review (P2)
  Objective: Document alternatives to QSBR and when they should be chosen (only if QSBR is unsuitable due to stalled threads or missing quiescent points).
  Reference:
    - Publish on Ping (2025): https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04250
    - Hyaline (2019): https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07903
  Where:
    - `runtime/docs/SMR_FOR_RUNTIME_STRUCTURES.md` (appendix) ✅
  Verification plan:
    - Decision matrix includes "how to test" and "what to measure" for each alternative. ✅
    - Decision matrix includes “how to test” and “what to measure” for each alternative.

# Review Notes

# OmniLisp Memory System — Review Task List (CTRR + Region‑RC)
Date: 2026-01-10

This file is a **review backlog** for the OmniLisp memory system. It is intentionally exhaustive so you can pick/choose later.

Scope:
- **CTRR (Compile‑Time Region Reclamation)**: compile-time scheduling of region lifetimes and escape repair points.
- **Region‑RC (Per‑Region Reference Counting)**: runtime liveness is determined by **region-level** reference counts + scope liveness (no heap-wide collector).
- Building components: regions, per-region RC, tethering/borrowing, transmigration, concurrency + tooling.

Status legend (for this file):
- `TODO`: Candidate work item.
- `DEFER`: Only do if/when needed (explicitly justify).
- `N/A`: Not applicable (include a one-line reason).

Non‑negotiable constraints (global):
- No stop‑the‑world GC; no heap-wide scanning collectors.
- No language-visible “sharing primitive” (no `(share v)` or similar).
- Optimizations must remain **inside** the single authoritative CTRR/Region‑RC machinery (no bypass special-case walkers).
- Benchmark claims must use a reproducible protocol (see Issue 8).

Primary references (read before implementing *any* memory-model task):
- `docs/CTRR.md` (normative CTRR contract: “everything can escape”, Region Closure Property)
- `runtime/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (runtime architecture + model naming)
- `runtime/docs/CTRR_TRANSMIGRATION.md` (clone/trace contract, external-root rule, correctness invariants)
- `runtime/docs/CTRR_REMAP_FORWARDING_TABLE.md` (forwarding/remap identity)
- `docs/ADVANCED_REGION_ALGORITHMS.md` (long-term region/transmigration plans)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 1 — Formalize “Per‑Region RC” Semantics (Make the Model Explicit)

Goal: eliminate ambiguity about what Region‑RC means and what correctness guarantees it provides.

- [TODO] Label: R1-model-spec-core
  Objective: Write an explicit spec for the **per-region reference counting** model, including invariants, allowed pointer directions, and what CTRR must insert at compile time.
  Reference: `docs/CTRR.md`, `runtime/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  Where:
    - New doc: `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md`
    - Update/align: `runtime/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (link to new doc)
  Why:
    “Per-region RC” only works robustly if we define:
    - what counts as an “external reference” to a region,
    - when a region may be reclaimed,
    - and how we prevent/handle region dependency cycles.
  What to write (minimum content checklist):
    1. **Region liveness rule:**
       - Region is alive iff `scope_alive == true || external_rc > 0`.
       - Region may free memory iff `scope_alive == false && external_rc == 0`.
    2. **Region Closure Property (runtime form):**
       - No pointers into dead regions.
    3. **External-root rule:**
       - Pointers outside the src region are treated as roots during transmigration and are not rewritten.
    4. **Region dependency DAG rule (see Issue 2):**
       - Define the “older-only store” rule or an equivalent rule that prevents region cycles.
    5. **Concurrency model hooks:**
       - define what operations may cross threads and what instrumentation/tooling is expected.
  Verification plan:
    - Add a short “spec conformance checklist” section to `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md`.
    - Ensure all existing docs link consistently (no contradictory naming).

- [TODO] Label: R1-define-external-ref-boundaries
  Objective: Define precisely which operations increment/decrement `external_rc` (or equivalent region-level refs).
  Reference: `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md` (to be written by R1-model-spec-core)
  Where:
    - New doc section: `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md` (“External references”)
    - Code touchpoints to list (do not implement here): `runtime/src/` modules for channel send/recv, closure capture, return, globals, etc.
  Why:
    Region‑RC is unsound if raw pointers can escape without RC updates; the runtime cannot observe arbitrary pointer copying.
  Implementation details (spec-level pseudocode):
    - On escape boundary (compile-time inserted):
      - `region_inc_external(root_region_of(value))` if value points into a region that outlives current scope.
      - `region_dec_external(...)` when the escape handle is dropped or transferred.
  Verification plan:
    - Spec must enumerate each escape boundary category:
      - return to parent/caller
      - closure capture
      - global store / module store
      - channel send/recv (cross-thread handoff)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 2 — Prevent Region Cycles (Region Dependency Graph Rule + Enforcement)

This is the largest “robustness unlock”. Per-region RC cannot reclaim cycles of regions, so we must prevent region dependency cycles by construction.

- [TODO] Label: R2-older-only-store-rule-spec
  Objective: Specify the **region dependency rule** that prevents region cycles (recommended: “older-only store”).
  Reference: `docs/CTRR.md` (Region Closure Property), `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md`
  Where:
    - New doc: `runtime/docs/REGION_DEPENDENCY_RULES.md`
  Why:
    Without an explicit rule, mutable Lisp updates can create:
    - older region objects pointing to younger region objects,
    - forming region cycles,
    - which per-region RC cannot collect.
  Spec content (minimum):
    - Define a region partial order (e.g., creation time / nesting depth).
    - Rule: a store into an object in region `R_old` may only reference values in `R_old` or an “older/equal” region (never a younger region).
    - If code attempts to store a younger pointer into an older object:
      - The runtime must **auto-repair** the store (no language changes, no user-visible `(share ...)`), using:
        - transmigration for “small” values/regions,
        - region coalescing/merge (“promote the region”) for “large” values/regions,
        - and a well-defined, reproducible size heuristic (see R2-auto-repair-policy below).
  Verification plan:
    - Doc includes a table of allowed/disallowed cases with examples.
    - Include at least 2 examples showing how this prevents region cycles.

- [TODO] Label: R2-runtime-write-barrier-plan
  Objective: Design a runtime **store barrier** strategy for cases the compiler cannot prove (dynamic stores), without changing language syntax.
  Reference: `runtime/docs/REGION_DEPENDENCY_RULES.md`
  Where (planned implementation points):
    - `runtime/src/runtime.c` (or wherever `set-car!`, `set-cdr!`, `dict-set!`, array set, etc. are implemented)
    - `runtime/src/memory/` (helpers to map pointer→region id/domain)
  Why:
    The language is mutable; if we don’t enforce the region rule at mutation points, cycles/leaks appear.
  Implementation plan (pseudocode; auto-repair, never abort):
    - `store_slot(obj_in_Rold, slot, value)`:
      1. Determine region of `obj` (R_obj).
      2. Determine region of `value` if pointer into a region (R_val).
      3. If `R_val` is younger than `R_obj`:
         - Choose repair action via the size heuristic (see R2-auto-repair-policy):
           - If “small”: `value2 = transmigrate(value, src=R_val, dst=R_obj_or_parent)` then store `value2`.
           - If “large”: `region_merge(R_val, into=R_obj_or_parent)` then store original `value` (now in unified lifetime).
  Verification plan:
    - Define tests that attempt illegal stores and confirm behavior is always safe and automatic (no abort):
      - illegal younger→older store triggers *either* transmigrate or merge, depending on configured heuristic thresholds.
    - Run under ASAN/TSAN once tooling exists (Issue 7/9).

- [TODO] Label: R2-auto-repair-policy
  Objective: Specify the **auto-repair** policy for illegal younger→older stores, including the “size heuristic” you want: small ⇒ transmigrate, large ⇒ coalesce/merge.
  Reference: `runtime/docs/REGION_DEPENDENCY_RULES.md`, `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md`
  Where:
    - Add section: `runtime/docs/REGION_DEPENDENCY_RULES.md` (“Auto-Repair Policy: Transmigrate vs Merge”)
    - Add section: `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md` (“Why region cycles must be prevented; why auto-repair is mandatory in a mutable Lisp”)
  Why:
    In a mutable Lisp, the program can create new lifetime dependencies at runtime via mutation. If the runtime doesn’t auto-repair these, per-region RC is either:
    - unsound (dangling pointers when younger regions die), or
    - incomplete (region cycles retained forever if cross-region refs keep regions alive).
    Auto-repair turns mutation-time lifetime changes into a guaranteed-safe operation.
  Policy requirements (must be explicit in the doc):
    1. **No user-visible syntax:** no `(share v)` or opt-in primitives.
    2. **No debug abort as the contract:** aborts may exist as optional instrumentation, but the language/runtime contract is “always repairs automatically”.
    3. **Deterministic decision:** given the same configuration and same allocation sizes, the repair choice should be predictable (for reproducible benchmarks).
    4. **No STW GC:** repair must be local (transmigrate) or structural (merge), never heap scanning.
  Size heuristic (recommended to document and implement in this order, from simplest to more precise):
    - Heuristic H0 (default): compare **region allocated bytes**:
      - if `bytes_allocated(R_val) >= MERGE_THRESHOLD_BYTES` ⇒ merge `R_val` into `R_obj`
      - else ⇒ transmigrate the stored value into `R_obj`
    - Heuristic H1 (optional): compare **estimated reachable size** from the stored root, with a bounded traversal budget:
      - stop after N nodes/bytes and treat as “large” if budget exceeded
      - NOTE: this is still not a GC (it only traverses the value graph being stored), but it is more complex and must be justified by perf wins.
  Merge safety constraints (must be explicit):
    - If merge cannot be performed safely (e.g., region ownership/threading constraints, or region is already shared in an incompatible way), then the runtime must fall back to transmigration (correctness over performance).
  Verification plan:
    - Provide 3 concrete behavioral examples in the doc:
      1. small young list stored into older dict ⇒ transmigrate
      2. large young region stored into older structure ⇒ merge
      3. merge not permitted ⇒ transmigrate fallback (still safe)

- [TODO] Label: R2-mutation-site-inventory
  Objective: Inventory every runtime mutation primitive that can create cross-region edges and therefore must use the store barrier / auto-repair policy.
  Reference: `runtime/docs/REGION_DEPENDENCY_RULES.md` (auto-repair contract)
  Where:
    - List and link to the exact functions implementing:
      - `set-car!`, `set-cdr!`
      - array/vector set
      - dict/map set
      - any internal structure mutations (closure/env updates, object field sets)
  Why:
    Region-cycle prevention fails if even one mutation path bypasses the barrier.
  Done means:
    - The inventory is complete and includes “how to test” each mutation site.
    - The inventory explicitly says “all must call the same store helper”.

- [TODO] Label: R2-auto-repair-tests
  Objective: Define a regression test plan proving auto-repair prevents region cycles without changing language syntax.
  Reference: `runtime/docs/REGION_DEPENDENCY_RULES.md`
  Where:
    - Planned tests: `runtime/tests/` (new test file, e.g. `test_region_cycle_prevention.c`)
  Test plan (minimum):
    1. **Younger→older store repairs safely (no dangling pointers):**
       - Create `R_old` and `R_young`.
       - Allocate container in `R_old`, value in `R_young`.
       - Perform mutation store.
       - Exit `R_young` scope.
       - Assert container still points to a valid object/value (either migrated or merged).
    2. **Heuristic branch coverage:**
       - Configure threshold low to force merge; verify merge path taken.
       - Configure threshold high to force transmigrate; verify transmigrate path taken.
    3. **No region cycles retained:**
       - Construct scenario that would create `R_old ↔ R_young` cycle without repair.
       - Verify that after repair the graph does not contain any pointer into a dead region and region liveness counters drop as expected.
  Verification commands:
    - `make -C runtime/tests test`
    - Add ASAN/TSAN commands once sanitizer gates exist (Issue 9).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 3 — Region Ownership + Cross‑Thread Handoff (Concurrency Robustness)

Pick a threading contract that matches “robustness + tooling”.

- [TODO] Label: R3-threading-contract-spec
  Objective: Specify the threading/ownership model for regions and objects (recommended: single-owner regions; cross-thread requires handoff/transmigrate).
  Reference: `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md`, `runtime/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  Where:
    - New doc: `runtime/docs/REGION_THREADING_MODEL.md`
    - Update: `runtime/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (link)
  Why:
    TSAN usefulness and overall robustness depend on having a clear contract:
    - either transmigrate is called under a runtime lock,
    - or regions/allocations are thread-safe (harder).
  Spec requirements:
    - Define “region owner” (thread id) conceptually (even if not implemented yet).
    - Define allowed cross-thread operations:
      - channel send/recv of values with region transfer or region inc/dec.
    - Define how Region‑RC interacts with handoff (who decrements external refs).
  Verification plan:
    - Add doc examples showing safe handoff vs unsafe concurrent mutation.

- [TODO] Label: R3-channel-handoff-mechanics
  Objective: Specify how channels transfer values without STW GC and without language-visible share constructs.
  Reference: `runtime/docs/REGION_THREADING_MODEL.md`
  Where:
    - New doc section: `runtime/docs/REGION_THREADING_MODEL.md` (“Channels”)
  Why:
    Channel handoff is a primary real-world escape boundary. If it’s ambiguous, concurrency bugs will dominate.
  Plan options (document both; pick one):
    - Option A: **Ownership transfer** of an entire region (fastest, most robust).
    - Option B: **Transmigrate on send** into receiver’s long-lived region (safe, more copying).
    - Option C: **Shared region** with locks (risky; only if needed).
  Verification plan:
    - Provide at least one test case per option in the spec (source + expected behavior).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 4 — Atomic Policy Layer (Robust Concurrency + Tooling)

Even if we remain C99, concurrency robustness improves dramatically if all atomics go through one auditable layer.

- [TODO] Label: R4-omni-atomic-wrapper-design
  Objective: Design an `omni_atomic.h` abstraction so the runtime can use C11 atomics when available, or `__atomic_*` intrinsics otherwise.
  Reference: `runtime/docs/REGION_THREADING_MODEL.md`
  Where:
    - New header: `runtime/include/omni_atomic.h`
    - New doc: `runtime/docs/ATOMIC_POLICY.md`
  Why:
    Tooling (TSAN) and correctness review require explicit ordering semantics; ad-hoc intrinsics are easy to misuse.
  API sketch (example):
    ```c
    typedef struct { /* impl */ } omni_atomic_u32;
    uint32_t omni_atomic_load_acquire(const omni_atomic_u32*);
    void omni_atomic_store_release(omni_atomic_u32*, uint32_t);
    uint32_t omni_atomic_fetch_add_relaxed(omni_atomic_u32*, uint32_t);
    uint32_t omni_atomic_fetch_sub_acqrel(omni_atomic_u32*, uint32_t);
    ```
  Memory-order policy doc (must include):
    - which counters can be relaxed (most refcount increments)
    - which transitions require acquire/release (dec-to-zero path)
  Verification plan:
    - Add a small unit test (if tests infra permits) for atomic wrapper correctness (single-thread sanity).
    - Add TSAN gate tests later (Issue 9).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 5 — Tethering / Borrowing Hardening (Epoch + Tripwires)

Tethering exists to keep borrowing safe without GC. Robustness depends on making violations loud.

- [TODO] Label: R5-region-epoch-borrow-tripwires
  Objective: Specify a region “epoch” mechanism and BorrowedRef validation in debug builds.
  Reference: `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md`, `runtime/docs/REGION_THREADING_MODEL.md`
  Where:
    - New doc section: `runtime/docs/REGION_TETHERING.md`
    - Planned code: `runtime/src/memory/region_core.{c,h}`, borrow/tether APIs
  Why:
    Without epoch-style validation, stale borrows become silent UAFs; tooling catches them only sometimes.
  Spec plan:
    - Each region has `uint64_t epoch`.
    - On region destroy: `epoch++` and (debug) poison memory.
    - BorrowedRef captures `(region_id, epoch_snapshot, tether_depth/handle)`.
    - On dereference (debug): assert region still alive and epoch matches.
  Verification plan:
    - Tests:
      - borrowing across tether end triggers abort in debug
      - borrow after region exit triggers abort in debug

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 6 — Regions (Allocator Policy, Inline Buffer, Accounting)

This is where you can win both robustness and performance without touching user code.

- [TODO] Label: R6-region-accounting-quotas
  Objective: Add a plan for per-region and global accounting (bytes, allocations, peak), and optional debug quotas.
  Reference: `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md`
  Where:
    - New doc: `runtime/docs/REGION_ACCOUNTING.md`
    - Planned code: `runtime/src/memory/region_core.c`, `runtime/include/omni.h`
  Why:
    Regions can “silently become long-lived” (retention cliff). Accounting makes issues visible.
  Plan details:
    - Track:
      - bytes allocated in region
      - chunk count
      - inline_buf usage
      - peak bytes
    - Optional debug quota:
      - abort with message “region exceeded quota; likely escape/retention”.
  Verification plan:
    - Provide a sample program and expected diagnostic output.

- [TODO] Label: R6-inline-buf-policy-and-domain
  Objective: Clarify inline_buf policy and ensure “in-region domain” includes inline allocations consistently (for bitmap, forwarding, and external-root classification).
  Reference: Phase 31 inline_buf coverage notes in `TODO.md`, `runtime/docs/CTRR_TRANSMIGRATION.md`
  Where:
    - `runtime/docs/REGION_DEPENDENCY_RULES.md` (domain note)
    - `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md` (domain note)
  Verification plan:
    - Tests must include objects allocated in inline_buf and ensure transmigration and domain checks behave correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 7 — Transmigration: Structural Work (Correctness + Performance)

These refer to phases already in `TODO.md` (40–47). This file records the “why” and the dependency structure so it’s visible in one place.

- [TODO] Label: R7-transmigrate-edge-choke-point-priority
  Objective: Treat “single edge rewrite choke point” (Phase 42) as the prerequisite for all future perf work to prevent regression churn.
  Reference: `TODO.md` Phase 42
  Verification plan:
    - When Phase 42 is implemented, require a check that no edge path allocates WorkItem nodes in hot path.

- [TODO] Label: R7-forwarding-as-visited-priority
  Objective: Prioritize “forwarding table as visited+remap” (Phase 40) to reduce per-edge bookkeeping.
  Reference: `TODO.md` Phase 40
  Verification plan:
    - Must run under forced forwarding mode and demonstrate (via counters) that bitmap/remap fallback is not exercised in the hot path.

- [TODO] Label: R7-pair-microkernel-priority
  Objective: Prioritize `TAG_PAIR` microkernel (Phase 41) after Phase 42, to remove both clone and trace indirection for cons-heavy graphs.
  Reference: `TODO.md` Phase 41
  Verification plan:
    - Must include header-invariant tripwires and list/array regression benchmarks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 8 — Benchmark Protocol (Reproducibility and Reportability)

Tooling matters: without reproducible benchmarks, performance work becomes narrative.

- [TODO] Label: R8-bench-protocol-spec
  Objective: Codify the benchmark protocol (compiler + flags + rebuild steps + reporting) as a doc and ensure every perf phase references it.
  Reference: Phase 39 protocol in `runtime/tests/Makefile`
  Where:
    - New doc: `runtime/docs/BENCH_PROTOCOL.md`
    - Update: `runtime/tests/bench_transmigrate_vs_c.c` (ensure it prints correct compiler/flags; avoid misleading “GCC 4.2.1” output if using clang)
  Why:
    “bench-rel” must be apples-to-apples: benchmark binary and runtime library must be built with consistent flags, or results are not comparable.
  Verification plan:
    - `bench-rel` output must print:
      - actual compiler ID and version
      - actual CFLAGS used to build *both* runtime and bench (or explicitly state if runtime was built differently)
      - mode name

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 9 — Tooling Gates: ASAN/TSAN/UBSAN Focused on Memory Model

This is where “tooling matters” becomes concrete.

- [TODO] Label: R9-sanitizer-contract-tests
  Objective: Add focused sanitizer stress tests specifically for region lifecycle + tethering + transmigration invariants.
  Reference: `runtime/tests/Makefile` sanitizer targets, `runtime/docs/REGION_THREADING_MODEL.md`
  Where:
    - `runtime/tests/` (new focused tests)
  Why:
    Sanitizers are most useful when they target well-defined invariants rather than random workloads.
  Plan:
    - ASAN: stress alloc/exit/transmigrate loops; ensure no UAF/leaks.
    - UBSAN: ensure no UB in bitmap/index math.
    - TSAN: only if threading contract is explicit; otherwise TSAN will produce false positives.
  Verification plan:
    - Provide exact commands to run and what “pass” means (no sanitizer reports within the scope of the focused tests).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 10 — Repo Hygiene (Build Artifacts Policy)

This is not “runtime code” but it materially affects robustness of the workflow.

- [TODO] Label: R10-build-artifact-policy
  Objective: Stop tracked build artifacts from polluting diffs and accidental commits, or document/enforce a strict policy if artifacts must remain tracked.
  Reference: `TODO.md` Phase 48
  Where:
    - Decide policy in `runtime/docs/DEV_HYGIENE.md` (new) and align with JJ workflow.
  Verification plan:
    - After running tests/bench, `jj status` should not show modified tracked binaries/objects under normal workflows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issue 11 — Internet‑Informed Techniques (Adopt What Helps, Without Violating CTRR/Region‑RC)

This issue captures external techniques worth incorporating **only if** they align with:
- CTRR (compile-time scheduling of region lifetimes and escape repair points),
- Region‑RC (per-region external reference counting, no heap-wide tracing),
- auto-repair on mutation stores (transmigrate for small, merge/coalesce for large),
- no stop-the-world GC,
- no language-visible “share” construct.

### Why this issue exists
We want robustness and performance improvements that have precedent in real systems and the literature, but we must:
1) avoid importing techniques that are secretly “GC in disguise” (heap scanning),
2) avoid techniques that require language surface changes,
3) keep concurrency/tooling explicit and testable.

### 11.1 Region‑RC precedent: “RC” safe C dialect (external pointer counting)

- [TODO] Label: R11-rc-model-crosscheck
  Objective: Cross-check OmniLisp’s Region‑RC model against the “RC” safe C dialect’s definition of “external pointers”, and extract what applies to OmniLisp.
  Reference:
    - RC overview: https://www.barnowl.org/research/rc/index.html
    - `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md` (to be written by Issue 1)
  Where:
    - Add appendix: `runtime/docs/REGION_RC_MODEL.md` (“Related work: RC dialect; differences in a mutable Lisp”)
  Why:
    RC’s core claim is: “per-region refcount of pointers not stored within the region” prevents premature frees. That maps directly to our external_rc concept, but OmniLisp needs mutation auto-repair, so the store barrier is non-optional.
  What to write:
    - Define “external pointer” in OmniLisp terms (stored outside region, or crossing region ownership boundary).
    - Explain why OmniLisp cannot rely on programmer-visible `alias_refptr/drop_refptr` style APIs (no surface changes).
    - Explain why mutation barrier + auto-repair replaces RC’s “abort on delete with non-zero refcount”.
  Verification plan:
    - Doc section includes at least 2 concrete examples (illegal younger→older store; channel handoff) showing how OmniLisp handles cases RC handles via explicit operations.

---

### 11.2 Non‑lexical regions, splitting, and sized allocations (compile-time inspiration)

- [TODO] Label: R11-nonlexical-region-inference-notes
  Objective: Extract actionable ideas from “Better Static Memory Management” and Spegion (non-lexical regions, splitting, sized allocations) and map them to CTRR roadmap items.
  Reference:
    - Aiken/Fähndrich/Levien 1995 tech report: https://digicoll.lib.berkeley.edu/record/139069
    - Tofte/Talpin 1997: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540196926139
    - Spegion (ECOOP 2025 LIPIcs): https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2025.15
    - `docs/CTRR.md`
  Where:
    - New doc: `docs/CTRR_REGION_INFERENCE_ROADMAP.md`
  Why:
    Even with runtime repair (transmigrate/merge), compile-time improvements reduce the rate of repairs and shrink region lifetimes (robustness + performance).
  What to write (concrete CTRR-aligned ideas; no new language syntax):
    - Non-lexical region end insertion driven by liveness (CTRR already does liveness; document explicit goals).
    - “Splittable regions” as an internal representation trick: allow the compiler/runtime to create subregions under one logical region, enabling later coalescence decisions (ties to your size heuristic).
    - Sized allocations: use runtime accounting to inform compile-time heuristics (e.g., predict big allocations; allocate directly into parent/global to avoid later repair).
  Verification plan:
    - Include 3 “before/after” pseudo examples: (1) early region end, (2) avoiding transmigration by allocating in outliving region, (3) how split regions could reduce copying during coalescence.

---

### 11.3 Pool/arena practice: shortest-lived pool guidance + “freeze/thaw” compaction analogue

- [TODO] Label: R11-pool-practice-guidance
  Objective: Incorporate “shortest-lived pool” guidance (from APR pools) into OmniLisp docs and diagnostic tooling, and evaluate whether a safe compaction/coalescence step (freeze/thaw style) applies to long-lived regions.
  Reference:
    - APR pools guidance: https://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/user/performance/prevent.html
    - APR::Pool overview: https://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/api/APR/Pool.html
    - MemArena freeze/thaw coalescence: https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/10.1.x/developer-guide/internal-libraries/MemArena.en.html
    - `runtime/docs/REGION_ACCOUNTING.md` (Issue 6)
  Where:
    - Update: `runtime/docs/REGION_ACCOUNTING.md` (“Retention cliffs and pool lifetime mismatches”)
    - New doc: `runtime/docs/REGION_COALESCE_POLICY.md` (if warranted)
  Why:
    Pool systems show the main failure mode of region allocators in real code: allocating into too-long-lived pools causes “leaks by retention”. Your auto-repair heuristic is exactly a runtime enforcement of “pick shortest lived pool”.
  What to do (tasks, not implementation here):
    1. Define diagnostics:
       - warn if a region becomes long-lived and is receiving many allocations that never escape (retention smell)
    2. Evaluate a “coalesce after init” operation for long-lived regions:
       - Not a GC: only done at explicit safe points (end of init phase).
       - Coalesce by copying known-live data into one chunk and releasing old chunks (like MemArena freeze/thaw).
       - Must be opt-in and benchmarked; may be DEFER if complexity outweighs gains.
  Verification plan:
    - Provide a toy “server init then steady-state” scenario and expected accounting output showing reduced fragmentation after coalesce.

### 11.4 Concurrency: Safe Memory Reclamation (SMR) for internal runtime structures (not heap GC)

These techniques are for **internal concurrent data structures** (e.g., lock-free queues/maps used by the runtime). They do not replace CTRR/Region‑RC, but can reduce locking and improve robustness.

- [TODO] Label: R11-rcu-qsbr-evaluation
  Objective: Evaluate whether QSBR/Userspace RCU-style quiescent states can be mapped onto OmniLisp’s tethering/borrow windows to protect internal read-mostly structures (metadata tables, interned symbol tables) without STW GC.
  Reference:
    - Userspace RCU docs: https://liburcu.org/
    - QSBR overview (LWN): https://lwn.net/Articles/573424/
    - `runtime/docs/REGION_THREADING_MODEL.md` (Issue 3)
  Where:
    - New doc: `runtime/docs/SMR_FOR_RUNTIME_STRUCTURES.md`
  Why:
    If concurrency matters, we need a plan for safely reclaiming nodes in internal structures without global locks. QSBR is fast but requires explicit quiescent state reporting — conceptually similar to “no borrows held / tether windows ended”.
  What to define:
    - Which runtime structures would benefit (list them explicitly).
    - Where quiescent states would be reported (end of bytecode instruction? end of GC-free safe point? end of tether?).
    - Why this is not heap GC: only internal DS nodes are reclaimed.
  Verification plan:
    - Provide at least one test scenario in the doc: concurrent reads, writer retires nodes, reclaim after quiescent period.
    - Tie to TSAN expectations (Issue 9).

- [TODO] Label: R11-hazard-pointers-and-variants-review
  Objective: Review hazard pointers and newer variants (e.g., publish-on-ping) as alternatives to QSBR for internal runtime structures, focusing on overhead vs robustness tradeoffs.
  Reference:
    - Publish on Ping (2025): https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04250
    - Hyaline (2019): https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07903
    - `runtime/docs/ATOMIC_POLICY.md` (Issue 4)
  Where:
    - `runtime/docs/SMR_FOR_RUNTIME_STRUCTURES.md` (appendix “Alternatives”)
  Why:
    QSBR is fast but can retain memory if threads don’t report quiescent states. Hazard-pointer families are more robust but can impose per-read overhead. We need an explicit choice per structure.
  What to produce:
    - A decision matrix for:
      - read-mostly global tables (prefer QSBR/RCU)
      - lock-free linked structures with heavy traversal (consider variants that reduce per-read fences)
  Verification plan:
    - Include a minimal microbenchmark plan for one internal DS (not the heap), gated by Issue 8 benchmark protocol.
